# Changelog

All notable changes to `@codedology/code-forge` are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver ahead of a 1.0.0 that
waits on a second real consumer (plan §10.4, Q17).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-26

### Added

- **`code-forge review`** — review only: runs the review engine on changes you already have (your
  branch against the merge base with the default branch, your uncommitted work, or `--files`), with
  no plan, coder or proof, and never closes a block. One verdict per file, a fix list, totals or one
  JSON document (`--json`); exit 0 only when every file is approved. The run and its worker are
  always ended, also on Ctrl-C, SIGTERM and timeouts. See `docs/review-only.md`.
- **Release tools:** `npm run release -- <patch|minor|major|x.y.z>` bumps every version location,
  moves the changelog, runs every check (with rollback), commits and tags; `npm run changelog --
  <type> "text"` records changes as you go. See `docs/releasing.md`.
- **GitHub Releases:** a tag push publishes to npm and then creates the GitHub Release from the
  changelog, with links to the npm version and the changelog.

### Changed

- **Reviewers see the acceptance clauses.** Every review packet now carries the block's acceptance
  clauses (redacted, cut to fit the packet budget); a block without readable clauses is still
  reviewed, with `(acceptance unavailable)`.

### Fixed

- CI is green on Linux: a macOS-only case-insensitivity test now skips on case-sensitive
  filesystems, and the Node 22/24 matrix no longer cancels one job when the other fails.

## [0.1.0] — first release

The `plan` → `harden` → `code` → `review` pipeline for cross-model, parallel, evidence-gated
feature delivery, as one CLI (`code-forge`) plus one Agent Skill.

### Added

- **CLI verbs:** `init`, `doctor`, `run`, `block`, `worker`, `review-file`, `spawn`, `s2`,
  `author`, `facts`, `plan check`, `proof`, `gates`, `jev`, `keys`, `ledger`, `report`, `resolve`,
  `models`, `list`, `remove`, `upgrade`, `validate`, `help`, `version`. Verbs are discovered from
  `src/cli/*.mjs`, so adding one never touches the router.
- **Setup wizard** (`code-forge init`): nine steps (tools, harnesses, provider matrix, multimodel,
  keys, engine, gates, proof, doctor), every question has a default, `--no-interaction` plus one
  override flag per answer, an agent gets one JSON line, a second run changes nothing.
- **Decision layer:** System 1 (Jev) answers typed questions in well under a second; System 2 is a
  fresh top-level session woken only when System 1 is unsure; deterministic escalation precedence
  (retry → escalate one level → System 2 hand-off → the top level patches once → stop for a human).
- **Review engine:** a file-done trigger starts one or more fresh, isolated reviewer sessions
  (adaptive by risk score, or two-provider consensus with a judge); a worker process runs review
  outside the coder's own sandbox so review keeps moving even when the coder has no network; fix
  rounds converge under a bounded rule (round ≥ 2 reviews only the fix hunks, the open finding
  count must strictly shrink every round, four rounds is the cap).
- **Two-tier proof policy:** `light` and `high` (by risk score, a configured path, or a
  security-sensitive change); a red→green runner proves a new test actually fails before the fix
  and passes after. **No tool-made mutation testing ships in 0.1.0** — see "Removed" below.
- **Engine adapters** for Claude Code, Codex and Grok (subprocess argv snapshots, forbidden-list
  rendering, closed-book sessions with the packet on stdin); Gemini/Cursor/Copilot get detection
  and skill linking only.
- **Ledger and report:** an append-only, signed, per-project ledger (`~/.code-forge/ledger/`) and
  a `code-forge report` verb with a terminal view and a `--export` JSON snapshot.
- **JSON Schema** for `.code-forge.yml` (`schema/code-forge.schema.json`) and a generated reference
  at `docs/reference/config.md` (`node scripts/gen-config-doc.mjs [--check]`).

### Security

- **`signer: same-user boundary only`** — signed ledger rows detect tampering by a different user
  or a rewritten history; they are not a defense against an attacker who already runs code as you.
  `doctor` always prints this line so nobody mistakes the signature for more than that.
- **Keys never reach a coder process.** Provider/Jev keys resolve only inside the worker or the
  orchestrator's own CLI calls (chain: `env:<NAME>` → OS keychain → 1Password, cached briefly →
  ask at setup only); `keys list` never prints a value; every output path is redacted.
- A **forbidden-command list** blocks a coder from starting its own worker, waiving a review, or
  running other orchestrator-only actions, rendered into each provider's own deny-list mechanism.

### Changed / decided late in the build

- **Q16 = cut (2026-09-25):** code-forge ships **no user-facing mutation-testing tool**. Proof for
  both the product and this package's own tests is plain unit/feature tests plus the red→green
  runner — exact assertions on the main behaviour, not "mutation-verified" coverage.
- **R10:** at most 2 coders run at a time (down from 3) for the rest of the build.
- **R13:** code-forge never runs against, installs into, or names any of Ricardo's own projects;
  the first real, end-to-end use is a neutral example repository shipped inside the package.

### Removed

- `@stryker-mutator/core`, `stryker.config.mjs` and the CI mutation-baseline job — this package
  builds itself with unit and feature tests only (R14); nothing in this repository's own history
  ran mutation testing.
